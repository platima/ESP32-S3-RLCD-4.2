// Debounced multi-click / long-press detector for one active-low button.
// Pure logic with no Arduino dependency (tools/tests drives it with synthetic
// timestamps).  Feed update() the raw pressed/not-pressed level every few
// milliseconds; it returns a gesture once one is complete:
//
//   CLICK_1 / CLICK_2 / CLICK_3   that many clicks, reported once the button has
//                                 been idle for `multiClickGapMs` (3+ clicks = CLICK_3)
//   CLICK_LONG                    held for `longPressMs`, reported while still held
