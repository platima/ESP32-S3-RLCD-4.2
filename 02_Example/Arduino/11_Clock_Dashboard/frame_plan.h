// When to draw the coming second and when to send it to the panel.
//
// Drawing a frame takes tens of milliseconds and the time varies (cache misses, the
// WiFi stack taking the memory bus, a flash write on the other core), while sending
// it is short.  So the coming second is drawn into the display buffer early, with
// room to spare, and sent just before it starts: the draw may run long without the
// digits changing late.  The panel refreshes itself at about 25 Hz, so a frame shows
// up 0-39 ms after it has been sent; the send is timed to end `latencyUs` before the
// second starts, which puts the average error at zero.
//
// Pure logic with no Arduino dependency: the UI loop asks next() whenever it wakes up
// and does what it says; tools/tests drives it with simulated clocks and stalls.
