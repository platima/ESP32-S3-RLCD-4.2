// The console can be shut down for good ("console = auto" or "off", console_policy.h): from then on LOGF
// prints nothing.  Any task may log, and the port must not be taken away under a task that is in the middle
// of a line, so every line is bracketed by logBegin() / logEnd() and the shutdown waits for the last one.

// which outlives a restart that is not a power-on.)

// Shuts the console down until the next restart: nothing more is printed, the serial driver is stopped (its
// interrupt and buffers freed) and, when Serial is the chip's USB port, the USB transceiver with its pull-up
// is switched off, so a computer no longer sees the clock.  Call it from the UI task.
