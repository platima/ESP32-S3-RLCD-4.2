// Infers "charging / discharging / full" from the battery voltage alone.
//
// The ESP32-S3-RLCD-4.2 has no software-readable charge signal: the charger's
// STAT output only drives an LED and the sole power signal wired to the MCU is
// the battery voltage on GPIO4 (see PIN_CHARGE_STATUS in config.h if you add a
// wire to it).  What the voltage does tells the story, though:
//
//   * plugging USB in makes the charger push current through the cell's internal
//     resistance, so the terminal voltage steps UP by tens of millivolts at once;
//     pulling it out steps it DOWN;
//   * while charging at constant current the voltage climbs a few mV a minute;
//     while the cell carries the load it falls (steeply near full, slowly in the
//     flat middle of the curve);
//   * once the charger finishes, the voltage sits flat near 4.2 V.
//
// Readings are reduced to one value per 15 seconds, taken from the upper end of
// the bin: a WiFi transmit burst can pull a single reading down by tens of
// millivolts but never up, so the highest readings are the clean ones.  Twelve
// minutes of those are kept.  Two things are looked at:
//   1. a step: the last 30 s against 90..150 s ago, which must stay beyond
//      +-40 mV for three evaluations running.  This reacts about a minute after
//      the cable moves;
//   2. the trend: the slope of the whole history, which settles the cases a step
//      cannot (booting on a charger, unplugging a full battery where no current
//      flowed so nothing steps).  It needs eight minutes of data.  A change in
//      load moves the level for good, and to a plain straight-line fit that looks
//      like a ramp (a 12 mV shift mid-window reads as +1.5 mV/min), so a claim of
//      charging also needs a second slope, fitted with one level shift allowed
//      anywhere (the pooled slope of the two stretches either side of the best
//      split), to agree.  A ramp survives that, a shift does not.  The trend is
//      not consulted while a step is being judged, nor for twelve minutes after
//      one (the step spoils it: a decline and a jump can cancel into "flat").
//
// The readings of the first three minutes are thrown away: the board draws more
// while it joins WiFi and fetches over TLS, the battery sags, and the recovery
// looks like a plug-in.
//
// A third thing is looked at for ending FULL: a slow history of one level per five
// minutes (four hours).  Unplugging a full battery gives no step, and a light load
// (the clock with its radio mostly off draws 10 to 45 mA, a 2500 mAh cell) makes the top of the
// curve fall by only 0.07 to 0.3 mV a minute, which the twelve-minute trend cannot tell
// from flat.  A charger holding the cell keeps it within a few millivolts of its plateau,
// though, while a load takes it down for good: FULL ends when the slow level has fallen
// 13 mV below the plateau (not counting the first minutes of FULL, in
// which the cell relaxes after the charger ended) ends FULL.  However
// FULL ended, flat is not taken for FULL again until the cell has not fallen by more than
// 1.2 mV in the last hour (a recharge, or a cell that sits still, gives that).  A fall of 0.3 mV a minute ends FULL after
// about an hour, one of 0.07 after three.
//
// It is a heuristic and says UNKNOWN rather than guessing when the evidence is
// thin (for instance in the flat middle of the discharge curve, or in the first
// minutes after boot).  FULL means "sitting flat at the top of the curve", which
// is what a charger holding the cell at 4.2 V looks like; it also reads as full
// for a while after unplugging a full battery (an hour or two with a light load).
// Pure logic with no Arduino dependency; tools/tests simulates plausible traces.
