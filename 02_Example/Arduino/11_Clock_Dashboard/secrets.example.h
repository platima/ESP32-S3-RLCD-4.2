// Copy this file to "secrets.h" and fill it in.
// secrets.h is listed in .gitignore, so your passwords stay out of git.
//
// Everything here can also be set from a settings file on an SD card (see the README), which
// is handier once the clock is built: no reflashing to change the WiFi, the units or the place.
// And the other way round: every setting the card can set can be built in here, to come pre-programmed.
// The names are in the last column of the README's settings table ("Building the settings in"); the
// ones below are the ones people usually want.  config.h has the factory value and the choices of each.
// Text and choices are written as on the card ("12h", "max"), yes / no as 1 / 0.  A value that does
// not pass the card's own checks is left out and reported on the Info page.

// WiFi (2.4 GHz; the ESP32-S3 does not do 5 GHz)

// While the clock is on the backup it looks for the main network every 10 minutes and goes back.

// Spotify (optional).  Paste the Client ID of your own app from
// https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard to turn on now-playing and the
// KEY button controls.  Leave it empty to run without Spotify.
// The README walks through creating the app and linking your account.
