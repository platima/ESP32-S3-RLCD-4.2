// Battery runtime estimate, for the Info page (never the main screen).
//
// The voltage is turned into a charge percentage through the discharge curve first.  The same
// drain in mA is a very different number of mV per minute depending on where on the curve the
// cell is (about 2 mV per percent in the middle, 15 and more near empty), so a trend in volts
// means little; a trend in percent is one steady rate all the way down.
//
//   * readings are boiled down to one point per 5 minutes, the median of that bin, which throws
//     away the dips of WiFi transmit bursts;
//   * the first 15 minutes after the clock went onto the battery are ignored (a cell just off
//     the charger is still settling and falls faster than it really drains);
//   * the rate is the slope of a straight line through the points of a window that adapts to the
//     drain: long enough that the cell loses about 20 % inside it, but never under 2 hours or
//     over 8.  (The middle of the curve is nearly flat, a few millivolts there are several
//     percent, so short windows chase noise: a 30 minute fit was off by 60 % or more one time in
//     ten in simulation, the adaptive 2 to 8 hour window by 15 to 40 %.  A fast drain still
//     gets the short end of that range, a slow one the long.)  Until two hours of history exist
//     it uses all there is, and the Info page says how many minutes the figure is based on;
//   * one round of outlier rejection, then "hours left" is the percent above the cut-off level
//     divided by that rate.
//
// It promises the time left at the *average* load of the window, which is the best guess when the
// load varies; it cannot know what you will do next.  Header-only and free of Arduino dependencies
// so tools/tests can simulate whole discharges; the constants in Params were chosen with
// tools/tests/battery_sim.cpp.  That is a model of a cell, not a measurement of yours.
